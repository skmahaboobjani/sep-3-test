    <h1>react components</h1>
    <p>Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but
        work in isolation and return HTML.

        Components come in two types, Class components and Function components.</p>

    <h1>Class Components</h1>

    <p>A class component must include the extends React.Component statement. This statement creates an inheritance to
        React.Component, and gives your component access to React.Component's functions.

        The component also requires a render() method, this method returns HTML.</p>


    <h1>Function Component</h1>
    <p>A Function component also returns HTML, and behaves much the same way as a Class component, but Function
        components can be written using much less code, are easier to understand.</p>
